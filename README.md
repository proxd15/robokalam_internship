Internship project using Django Framework

This is my internship submission project as a part of the second round for selection.

I built this project using Django Framework.

After downloading the zip file from github , these steps must be followed to run the project :

1. Download Python from web.
2. After installing python , run windows powershell as admin and type python. If python is successfully installed on your computer , it will show current version of        python.
3. After installing python , you need to install django. To install Django --> type in powershell - pip intall django -- Django will successfully be installed on your      computer.
4. Now open the file named "web_template_video" of the project in any IDE of your choice.
5. Now in terminal , type the command - python manage.py runserver
6. The development server will start.
7. For ex . "http://127.0.0.1:8000/" -- this type of url you will see in terminal , open that url.
8. On the homepage - the web tenplate will appear - Live Streaming Web Application , no backend is included as not mentioned in the details.
9. Now for the second project - create a form with database , change the url to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/form/formdb".
10. The desired form will appear , enter the details and the appliaction will save the data in database. 

NOTE : To access the database : http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin after the development server starts
